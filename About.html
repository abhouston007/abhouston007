					Hello, I am Andrew Houston. I have always been interested in creating new and exciting things since I was
young. I was going to Auburn University for Computer Programing before discovering that ASU had a Graphic
Information Tech program online. I immediately switched so I could be apart of creating Design and models
that could change the world.
I make my decisions based on what I would want my child to do. This ideology has turned me into I am.
Honesty and integrity are who I am and who I want my son to be. I want to make a positive change in this
world. I work hard to provide for my family in hopes to give my son a better life than me. I hope that one day
he will give his children a better life than he has had.
